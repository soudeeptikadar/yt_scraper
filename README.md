# YouTube Scraping Project

This project scrapes YouTube channel video metrics (views, likes, comments) from the last 15 days using the YouTube API. The data is stored in a CSV file and can also be appended to Google Sheets.

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
